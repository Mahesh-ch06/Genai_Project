# Human Action Recognition Project

Welcome to the **Human Action Recognition (HAR)** project!

Due to GitHub's file size limit (25MB), the project files — especially the video and image datasets — could not be directly uploaded here.  
Instead, I have provided **Google Colab** links where you can access and run the complete project.

## Project Links

- **HAR with Images**:  
  [Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qb_gPtBzxC4DIKIcUvmstPJAucFVFeYB?usp=sharing)

- **HAR with Videos**:

## About the Project

This project focuses on recognizing human actions using deep learning techniques.

- **Image-based HAR**: Classifies human activities from static images.
- **Video-based HAR**: Classifies actions from sequences of video frames.

### Key Features:
- CNN-based models for classification
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Training and evaluation with detailed visualizations
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## How to Run

1. Open the provided **Google Colab** links.
2. Follow the instructions inside the notebook to:
   - Load data
   - Train the model
   - Evaluate performance
3. No local installation needed — everything runs directly in Colab!

## Notes

- If you wish to run locally, please make sure you have a strong GPU available.
- Downloading datasets and models might require additional Google Drive storage.

---

## Future Work

- Extend the dataset with more complex activities.
- Implement real-time action recognition using OpenCV.
- Optimize models for mobile deployment.
